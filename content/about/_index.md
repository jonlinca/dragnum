DRAGNUM is a mixed club, comprised of a core who have been paddling together for more than a decade, plus awesome new recruits each season. We are a fitness oriented group and our goal is to place at or near the top of every festival we enter.

We also often race the women’s division at festivals by joining forces with other teams.

## Season

Boats are typically launched in May. Our practices run between May to September, our on-water practices are twice weekly:

Thursdays from 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM

Sundays from 4:30 PM - 6:00 PM

In September, Thursday evening practices will start earlier due to the shorter days.

## Structure

DRAGNUM runs two teams within the club, **Competitive** & **Semi-Competitive**, and both teams participate in 3-4 festivals in a typical year. The goal is that both our teams are in the top bracket finals. 

Our competitive team has the following expectations:

Practices - Twice a week  
Race Rosters - Results oriented  
Off-season program - Structured and accountable with fitness testing  

Our semi-competitive team has the following expectations:

Practices - Once to twice a week  
Race Rosters - Get race experience while being results oriented  
Off-season program - Encouraged  

We practice as a club, together - we mix up teams regularily to ensure everyone develops and grows as one cohesive club.

## Join

We are always looking for new recruits, from novice to experienced paddlers. This is a great time to join the team. [Contact us](../contact) and let us know if you’d like to come on out and try a practice.
