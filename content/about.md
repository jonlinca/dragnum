DRAGNUM is a mixed team, comprised of a core who have been paddling together for more than a decade, plus awesome new recruits each season. We are a fitness oriented group and our goal is to place at or near the top of every festival we enter.

We also often race the women’s division at festivals by joining forces with other teams.

We practice twice a week and compete in 3-4 festivals in a typical year.

We are always looking for new recruits. Are you interested in joining us? This is a great time to join the team. Use the [contact](/contact) form to let us know if you’d like to come on out and try a practice.

Boats are typically launched in May. Our practices will run between May to September, our on-water practices are twice weekly:

* Thursdays from 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM
* Sundays from 4:30 PM - 6:00 PM. 

In September, Thursday evening practices will start earlier due to the shorter days.
