DRAGNUM is a mixed team, comprised of a core who have been paddling together for more than a decade, plus awesome new recruits each season.  We are a fitness oriented group and our goal is to place at or near the top of every festival we enter.

## 2022

After a missed 2020 season, and limited racing in 2021, we are planning to ramp it up again in 2022.

We anticipate being back to normal, with the following planned race schedule:

Lethbridge, AB - June

Calgary, AB - August

Penticton, BC - September
